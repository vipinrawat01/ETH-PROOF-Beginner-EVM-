# Project Title 
 Create a Token 

#  Description
This program defines a simple token contract called MyToken with the following features:

* Public variables to store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
* A mapping to keep track of balances associated with addresses.
* A mint function to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
* A burn function to destroy tokens from a specified address, ensuring the address has sufficient balance to burn the tokens.
# Getting Started
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE:

* Go to the Remix website at Remix.
* Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
* Copy and paste the code provided above into the new file.
# Compile the code:
Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version).
Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

# Deploy the contract:
Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the contract:
Click on the MyToken contract in the left-hand sidebar.
Use the mint function to add tokens to an address.
Use the burn function to remove tokens from an address, ensuring the address has sufficient balance.
